# RehabPlus
Designed for orthopedic surgeons, physiotherapists, and patients, Rehab Plus is a post-surgical/injury recovery application. Built with React Native/ TypeScript and React Navigation, it offers robust backend support with Firebase integration for Authentication and Firestore for the database.

## Features

- Patients can access protocols assigned by their practitioner, allowing for structured and efficient recovery. Each exercise within these protocols comes with a detailed video and description.

- Practitioners can use pre-made protocols or design their own from an extensive exercise database. This flexibility ensures that they can provide the best tailored recovery plan for their patients.

- Progress Tracking: Patients' progress in terms of range of motion and strength is meticulously tracked. This empowers both the patient for self-monitoring and the practitioner for evaluation and adjustments.

- Efficiency for Physiotherapists: Backend protocol adjustments are streamlined, saving time and ensuring that changes can be made quickly and effectively.
